						<p>While the best-known and most successful digital currency – Bitcoin – is indeed a part of many of our clients’ portfolios, our expertise goes beyond a long-term buy and hold strategy for Bitcoin. We assist wealth managers in obtaining and managing a wide range of digital assets, including newly launched high-growth digital currencies, app coin shares in blockchain companies, and investment in digital currency mining operations. We work face to face with our clients to ensure they have a clear understanding of how their investment will operate and remain secure.</p>

						<h3>Bitcoin</h3>
						<p>Bitcoin is a digital currency tied to technology called the blockchain, which is a peer-to-peer distributed ledger of timestamped transactions. Instead of an investment in a country’s economy, holding Bitcoins is often seen as an investment in the network and technology behind Bitcoin and the blockchain.  Bitcoin has become more stable over time, with consistent upward trends since the middle of 2015.  We assist our clients in securely buying, holding, and selling bitcoin in long and short positions, both online and via OTC brokers.

						<h3 >Alternative Digital Currencies</h3>
						<p>Whenever a networked group runs their own version of the blockchain with alternative rules, these peers will effectively be running a new cryptocurrency. This new blockchain will account for holdings of a new scarce token often called an “alt-coin.” Rather than change a version of Bitcoin software by creating a fork, a developer may also start a new cryptocurrency from scratch. Many of these alternative digital currencies have wide fluctuations in value as users discover new ways to utilize the coins. A notable example of a recent alt-coin is Z-Cash, a Bitcoin-like alternative digital currency that, unlike Bitcoin, allows users and their purchases to remain completely anonymous. We assist our clients in securely buying, holding, and selling these altcoins both in long and short positions.</p>

						<h3 >Mining Operations</h3>
						<p>Buying digital assets isn't the only way to acquire them.  Most digital currencies automatically reward users that maintain and secure the digital currency network. Digital asset “mining” is really a misnomer.  When gold is mined, nothing is achieved beyond the discovery of new gold.  When bitcoins or other digital currency are mined, however, a valuable service is provided in the form of transaction validation.  Depending on the current price of a digital asset and the expected valuation of that digital asset in the future, it may be more cost effective to deploy digital miners instead of directly purchasing the asset.  We assist our clients in securing contracts to rent third party miners from reputable companies and can provide infrastructure to help customers bootstrap and secure their own digital assets.</p>

						<div class="box">
						<span class="image featured"><img src="images/appcoins.png" alt="" /></span>
						<h3 >Blockchain Companies & Digital Equity</h3>
						<p>In order to provide some specific consumer or enterprise service that would benefit from an open, shared, and irreversible ledger—a blockchain—developers create protocols built on top of an existing cryptocurrency.  Whereas Bitcoin can be viewed as a general payments network in which users must use bitcoins to conduct transactions, there are now smart contracting platforms, cloud storage solutions, and social networking apps all with their own proprietary coins built on top of bitcoin.</p>
<p>There are already numerous exchanges where speculators buy and sell various appcoins similar to traditional forex or securities markets.  Just as the value of an individual bitcoin can be seen as tied to the value of the bitcoin network, these alternative cryptocurrencies trade at prices based on the perceived value of the platforms and projects associated with each coin.  Purchasing an appcoin is less like an investment in a traditional currency and more like an equity investment in a company.</p>
