<p>Inca Digital Securities deploys customized hardware to further assist our clients. We provide each of our clients with a USB key, tablet, or laptop that is preconfigured with custom software to eliminate IT security risks associated with investing in digital assets. This “secure environment”, as we call it, addresses the key issue that has been the cause of every major loss in the history of digital currency: trust. Companies lose funds because they hold customer encryption keys.  Instead of asking you to give us your digital wallets and encryption keys, we shift the trust into open source software, which has repeatedly proven to be the only reliable countermeasure to hacking, developer fraud, and government backdoors. Using our legal and IT security experience in both the private sector and government, we carefully pick technologies and software that will keep your private information and digital assets secure.</p>

<p>To date, we have created a modified, totally secure, tablet pre-loaded with instructions and third party applications that allow users to purchase and manage their own digital assets on-the-go. We securely backup all data for easy retrieval, and we continually monitor and update your device. Here are just a few of the services you will see in your secure investment environment…</p>

<h3><span class="icon minor fa-pie-chart accent2"></span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Digital Portfolio Consolidation and Management</h3> <p>We put together an investment toolkit comprised of cryptocurrency wallets, analytical software, and everything else needed to acquire, store, and use digital assets. Some of the tools have enhanced security features - such as 2-factor authentication and multisig - paired with quick and easy set-up guides.</p>

<h3><span class="icon minor fa-key accent2"></span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Key Management and Communication</h3> <p>Keeping accounts and passwords secure can be a challenge for digital asset users. We assist clients by providing setup tools that generate and store all necessary security keys and settings. After the initial setup process is complete, users will have access to a password manger, pgp-enabled email, and secure chat applications.</p>

<h3><span class="icon minor fa-cloud accent2"></span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Backup</h3> <p>In addition to hardening open-source operating systems with encryption and security tools, we provide our users with a zero-knowledge backup service that encrypts all data before sending it to the cloud, making it unreadable outside of our secure environment. If a client loses her device, she will be able to restore all her digital assets, settings, and encryption keys in a matter of minutes.</p>

<h3><span class="icon minor fa-wrench accent2"></span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Updates</h3> <p>We will provide software updates to all of our devices. We carefully monitor and screen every update to make sure patches do not affect system functionality and no malicious code is introduced.</p>
